# Overview

This project is a custom implementation inspired by Hazel, focusing on game engine fundamentals. It aims to replicate essential features like scene management, physics simulation, scripting, and rendering. Built for learning and experimentation, this project explores the core principles behind game development.

## Technical Stack  
-	Language: C++
-	Libraries: OpenGL, ImGui, SDL2, Box2D

## Key Features  
-	Scene Management – Load, save, and switch between different game scenes using YAML format.
-	Game Object System – Supports objects with components using a basic ECS system.
-	Physics Simulation – Collision detection and rigid body physics using Box2D.
-	Scripting Support – Custom C++ scripting similar to Unity’s MonoBehaviour
-	Rendering Engine – Uses OpenGL to handle 2D object rendering.
-	Input Handling – Detects keyboard and mouse inputs using SDL2.
-	UI System – Simple UI components for menus, buttons,… with ImGui.
